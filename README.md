# HR-Database-in-PostgreSQL
Designing an HR Database in PostgreSQL for Tech ABC Corp
This git repository holds the SQL codes and all artifacts required for designing and building the HR database in PostgreSQL as per the below business requirement.

**Business requirement**
Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with their new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth, since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has becoming increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands.

As such, the HR department has tasked you, as the new data architect, to design and build a database capable of managing their employee information.

**Dataset**
The HR dataset you will be working with is an Excel workbook which consists of 206 records, with eleven columns. The data is in human readable format, and has not been normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.

**IT Department Best Practices**
The IT Department has certain Best Practices policies for databases you should follow, as detailed in the Best Practices document.
